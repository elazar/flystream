[Flysystem v2/3](https://flysystem.thephpleague.com/v2/docs/) + [PHP stream wrappers](https://www.php.net/manual/en/class.streamwrapper.php) = ðŸ”¥

Flystream enables you to use core PHP filesystem functions to interact with Flysystem filesystems by registering them as custom protocols.

Released under the [MIT License](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License).

## Supported Use Cases

* Using Flysystem with another library that interacts with the filesystem using PHP filesystem functions instead of Flysystem.
* Intercepting filesystem operations for verification in tests.
* Improving the speed of tests where the code under test would otherwise require access to the local filesystem.

## Unsupported Use Cases

* Flystream doesn't and won't support Flysystem v1. If you want a similar library for v1, see [twistor/flysystem-stream-wrapper](https://github.com/twistor/flysystem-stream-wrapper).

## Known Issues

* If a file or directory handle is not explicitly closed after use (i.e. using [`fclose()`](https://www.php.net/fclose) or [`closedir()`](https://www.php.net/closedir) as appropriate), PHP will implicitly attempt to close it during [shutdown](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.register-shutdown-function.php). This situation may trigger a segmentation fault in some environments. This issue has [been resolved](https://github.com/elazar/xdebug-date-stream-php-segfault) and is available in PHP 7.4.23, 8.0.10, and 8.1.0. In older versions, the easiest work-around is to ensure that file and directory handles are explicitly closed.

## Requirements

* PHP 8.1+
* Flysystem 2 or 3

## Installation

Use [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/).

```sh
composer require elazar/flystream
```

**Note**: This will automatically install the latest version of the Flysystem core library that is available for your environment. However, you must handle installing adapters yourself. See [the Flysystem documentation](https://flysystem.thephpleague.com/docs/) for a list of official adapters.

## Usage

If you want to run the examples below, you will need to install [`league/flysystem-memory`](https://packagist.org/packages/league/flysystem-memory).

```sh
composer require league/flysystem-memory
```

These examples below aren't comprehensive, but should provide a basic understanding of the capabilities of Flystream.

```php
<?php

/**
 * 1. Configure your Flysystem filesystem to use the Flystream path
 *    normalizer; see the "Path Normalization" section of this README for
 *    more details.
 */

use Elazar\Flystream\ServiceLocator;
use League\Flysystem\Filesystem;
use League\Flysystem\InMemory\InMemoryFilesystemAdapter;
use League\Flysystem\PathNormalizer;

$adapter = new InMemoryFilesystemAdapter;
$config = [ /* ... */ ];
$pathNormalizer = ServiceLocator::get(PathNormalizer::class);
$filesystem = new Filesystem($adapter, $config, $pathNormalizer);

/**
 * 2. Register the filesystem with Flystream and associate it with a
 *    custom protocol (e.g. 'mem').
 */

use Elazar\Flystream\FilesystemRegistry;

$registry = ServiceLocator::get(FilesystemRegistry::class);
$registry->register('mem', $filesystem);

/**
 * 3. Interact with the filesystem using the custom protocol.
 */

mkdir('mem://foo');

$file = fopen('mem://foo/bar', 'w');
fwrite($file, 'baz');
fclose($file);

file_put_contents('mem://foo/bar', 'bay');

$contents = file_get_contents('mem://foo/bar');
// or
$contents = stream_get_contents(fopen('mem://foo/bar', 'r'));

if (file_exists('mem://foo/bar')) {
    rename('mem://foo/bar', 'mem://foo/baz');
    touch('mem://foo/bar');
}

$file = fopen('mem://foo/baz', 'r');
fseek($file, 2);
$position = ftell($file);
ftruncate($file, 0);
fclose($file);

$dir = opendir('mem://foo');
while (($entry = readdir($dir)) !== false) {
    echo $entry, PHP_EOL;
}
closedir($dir);

unlink('mem://foo/bar');
unlink('mem://foo/baz');

rmdir('mem://foo');

// These won't have any effect because Flysystem doesn't support them.
chmod('mem://foo', 0755);
chown('mem://foo', 'root');
chgrp('mem://foo', 'root');

/**
 * 4. Optionally, unregister the filesystem with Flystream.
 */
$registry->unregister('mem');
```

## Configuration

For its most basic use, Flystream requires two parameters:

1. a string containing a name for a custom protocol used by PHP filesystem functions; and
2. an object that implements the Flysystem `FilesystemOperator` interface (e.g. an instance of the `Filesystem` class).

### Path Normalization

The Flysystem `Filesystem` class supports normalization of supplied paths before they're passed to the underlying adapter. The Flysystem `PathNormalizer` interface represents this normalization process.

The implementation of this interface that Flysystem uses by default is `WhitespacePathNormalizer`, which handles normalizing the directory separator (i.e. converting `\` to `/`), removing abnormal whitespace characters, and resolving relative paths.

If you're using a third-party adapter, you'll probably need path normalization to include removing the custom protocol used to register the Flysystem filesystem with Flystream. As such, by default, Flystream registers a custom path normalizer that it defines, `StripProtocolPathNormalizer`. You can configure your `Filesystem` instance to use this normalizer like so.

```php
<?php

use Elazar\Flystream\ServiceLocator;
use League\Flysystem\Filesystem;
use League\Flysystem\PathNormalizer;

// $adapter = ...
// $config = ...
$normalizer = ServiceLocator::get(PathNormalizer::class);
$filesystem = new Filesystem($adapter, $config, $normalizer);
```

If you would prefer to limit protocols removed by `StripProtocolPathNormalizer` to a specified list, you can do so by specifying a custom instance that sets a value for its first parameter.

```php
<?php
use Elazar\Flystream\ServiceLocator;
use Elazar\Flystream\StripProtocolPathNormalizer;

// To remove a single protocol, specify it as a string
$pathNormalizer = new StripProtocolPathNormalizer('foo');

// To remove more than one protocol, specify them as an array of strings
$pathNormalizer = new StripProtocolPathNormalizer(['foo', 'bar']);

ServiceLocator::set(PathNormalizer::class, $pathNormalizer);
```

`StripProtocolPathNormalizer` also supports applying a second path normalizer after it performs its own normalization. By default, it uses Flysystem's `WhitespacePathNormalizer` as this secondary normalizer. If you'd rather that `StripProtocolPathNormalizer` not use a secondary normalizer, you can override this behavior like so.

```php
<?php

use Elazar\Flystream\PassThruPathNormalizer;
use League\Flysystem\PathNormalizer;
use Elazar\Flystream\ServiceLocator;
use Elazar\Flystream\StripProtocolPathNormalizer;

ServiceLocator::set(PathNormalizer::class, new StripProtocolPathNormalizer(

    // This is the default and results in the removal of all protocols
    null,

    // This normalizer returns the given path unchanged
    new PassThruPathNormalizer

));
```

If you'd rather not apply any path normalization, you can use the `PassThruPathNormalizer` normalizer class provided by Flystream to do this.

```php
<?php

use Elazar\Flystream\PassThruPathNormalizer;
use League\Flysystem\PathNormalizer;
use Elazar\Flystream\ServiceLocator;

ServiceLocator::set(PathNormalizer::class, new PassThruPathNormalizer);
```

### Buffering

Flysystem [doesn't support append operations](https://flysystem.thephpleague.com/v2/docs/what-is-new/#no-more-update-updatestream-put-and-putstream), in part because some of its drivers don't (e.g. AWS S3).

The default size of the PHP stream write buffer [differs between PHP 7.4 and 8.0](https://3v4l.org/RiENn), which may result in more than one write operation if the size of the data written exceeds the buffer size.

Because of these circumstances, Flystream buffers written data and then writes or "flushes" it out to the destination.

Flystream offers native support for these buffer strategies:

* **Memory**: Buffers strictly in memory. This has the best performance, but also the highest memory usage.
* **File**: Buffers strictly in a temporary file. This has the worst performance, but also the least memory usage.
* **Overflow**: Buffers in memory up to a configurable limit, then switches to using a temporary file. Its performance and memory usage generally lies between the two strategies above.

By default, Flystream uses the Memory strategy for optimal performance. Below are examples of overriding this setting to use a different strategy.

```php
<?php

use Elazar\Flystream\BufferInterface;
use Elazar\Flystream\ServiceLocator;

// To use the File strategy:
use Elazar\Flystream\FileBuffer;
ServiceLocator::set(BufferInterface::class, FileBuffer::class);

// To use the Overflow configuration with a default memory cap of 2 MB:
use Elazar\Flystream\OverflowBuffer;
ServiceLocator::set(BufferInterface::class, OverflowBuffer::class);

// To use the Overflow configuration with a custom memory cap:
// @var int Memory limit in bytes (2 MB in this example)
$maxMemory = 2 * 1024**2;
$buffer = new OverflowBuffer;
$buffer->setMaxMemory($maxMemory);
ServiceLocator::set(BufferInterface::class, $buffer);
```

You may want to check the value of your [`memory_limit`](https://www.php.net/manual/en/ini.core.php#ini.memory-limit) PHP INI setting and use either a [profiler](http://xdebug.org/docs/profiler) or functions like [`memory_get_usage()`](https://www.php.net/memory_get_usage) and [`memory_get_peak_usage()`](https://www.php.net/memory_get_peak_usage) to get an idea of which strategy is best for your use case.

Another option is using your own buffer strategy implementation, by creating a class that implements `BufferInterface` and then configuring Flystream to use it in the same fashion as the above examples.

### Visibility

Flysystem implements an abstraction layer for [visibility](https://flysystem.thephpleague.com/v2/docs/usage/unix-visibility/) and an implementation for handling [Unix-style visibility](https://flysystem.thephpleague.com/v2/docs/usage/unix-visibility/).

By default, Flystream uses this Unix-style visibility implementation with its default configuration. If you want to override its settings, you can override it with a configured instance.

```php
<?php

use Elazar\Flystream\ServiceLocator;
use League\Flysystem\UnixVisibility\PortableVisibilityConverter;
use League\Flysystem\UnixVisibility\VisibilityConverter;

ServiceLocator::set(VisibilityConverter::class, new PortableVisibilityConverter(
    // ...
));
```

You can also configure Flystream to use a custom visibility implementation.

```php
<?php

use Elazar\Flystream\ServiceLocator;
use League\Flysystem\UnixVisibility\VisibilityConverter;
use My\CustomVisibilityConverter;

// If your implementation doesn't require constructor parameters:
ServiceLocator::set(VisibilityConverter::class, CustomVisibilityConverter::class);

// If your implementation requires constructor parameters:
ServiceLocator::set(VisibilityConverter::class, new CustomVisibilityConverter(
    // ...
));
```

### Locking

By default, the Flysystem [Local adapter](https://flysystem.thephpleague.com/v1/docs/adapter/local/) uses [file locks](https://flysystem.thephpleague.com/v1/docs/adapter/local/#locks) during writes and updates, but allows overriding this behavior.

Flystream follows suit. It defines an interface, `LockRegistryInterface`, and two implementations of this interface, `LocalLockRegistry` and `PermissiveLockRegistry`. By default, Flystream uses the former, which is a naÃ¯ve implementation that prevents the current PHP process from reading a file already open for writing or writing to a file already open for reading.

If you'd rather disable locking entirely, you can configure Flystream to use the latter implementation, which grants all requested lock acquisitions and releases.

```php
<?php

use Elazar\Flystream\LockRegistryInterface;
use Elazar\Flystream\PermissiveLockRegistry;
use Elazar\Flystream\ServiceLocator;

ServiceLocator::set(
    LockRegistryInterface::class,
    PermissiveLockRegistry::class
);
```

Another option is to create your own lock registry implementation, such as a distributed one that handles locking between PHP processes using a library such as [`php-lock/lock`](https://github.com/php-lock/lock).

```php
<?php

namespace My;

use Elazar\Flystream\Lock;
use Elazar\Flystream\LockRegistryInterface;

class CustomLockRegistry implements LockRegistryInterface
{
    public function acquire(Lock $lock): bool
    {
        // ...
    }

    public function release(Lock $lock): bool
    {
        // ...
    }
}
```

Then, configure Flystream to use it.

```php
<?php

use Elazar\Flystream\LockRegistryInterface;
use Elazar\Flystream\ServiceLocator;
use My\CustomLockRegistry;

// If your implementation doesn't require constructor parameters:
ServiceLocator::set(
    LockRegistryInterface::class,
    CustomLockRegistry::class
);

// If your implementation requires constructor parameters:
ServiceLocator::set(
    LockRegistryInterface::class,
    new CustomLockRegistry(
        // ...
    )
);
```

### Logging

Flystream supports any [PSR-3](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-3/) logger and logs all calls to its stream wrapper methods.

By default, it uses the `NullLogger` implementation included with [`psr/log`](https://packagist.org/packages/psr/log), which discards the log entries. You can override this to use a different logger, such as [Monolog](https://packagist.org/packages/monolog/monolog).

```php
<?php

use Elazar\Flystream\ServiceLocator;
use Monolog\Logger;
use Psr\Log\LoggerInterface;

$logger = new Logger;
// configure $logger here
ServiceLocator::set(LoggerInterface::class, $logger);
```

[Core buffer implementations](#buffering) do not implement logging. However, as of Flystream 0.4.0, a buffer instance can be wrapped in an instance of the `LoggingCompositeBuffer` class to log calls to its methods. An example of doing this with the default `MemoryBuffer` buffer implementation is shown below.

```php
<?php

use Elazar\Flystream\BufferInterface;
use Elazar\Flystream\LoggingCompositeBuffer;
use Elazar\Flystream\MemoryBuffer;
use Elazar\Flystream\ServiceLocator;
use Monolog\Logger;
use Psr\Log\LoggerInterface;

$logger = new Logger;
// configure $logger here
$buffer = new LoggingCompositeBuffer(new MemoryBuffer, $logger);
ServiceLocator::set(BufferInterface::class, $buffer);
```

## Design

### Service Locator

Flystream uses a [singleton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern) [service locator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_locator_pattern) rather than a more commonly accepted [dependency injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection) configuration due to how PHP uses its stream wrapper classes. Specifically, PHP implicitly creates an instance of the stream wrapper class each time you use the associated custom protocol, and doesn't allow for dependency injection.

This requires use of a service locator for the stream wrapper to have access to dependencies, a singleton in particular so that the stream wrapper uses the same container that the end user configures to override default dependency implementations. The stream wrapper class limits its use of the service locator to a single method that fetches a dependency from the container of the singleton instance. It also supports injecting a custom singleton instance, in particular for testing. These measures limit the impact of the disadvantages of using the service locator pattern.

## Development and Testing

### Environment Variables

The following environment variables are required for running tests:

* `PHP_VERSION`: Specifies the PHP version to use for testing
  * Supported values: 81, 82, 83, 84
  * Example: `PHP_VERSION=84`
  * This variable is required for running tests in containers

### Development Tools

Development tasks can be run using the `dev-tools.sh` script, which provides a unified interface for testing, code style checking, and cleanup operations across multiple PHP versions.

#### Available Commands

- **test**: Run tests using Pest
- **cs**: Run code style fixer using PHP-CS-Fixer
- **cleanup**: Clean up generated files

#### Usage Examples

```bash
# Run tests for all supported PHP versions
./dev-tools.sh test

# Run tests for specific PHP versions
./dev-tools.sh test 81 82

# Run code style fixer for PHP 8.4 with container rebuild
./dev-tools.sh cs -f 84

# Clean up generated files for all PHP versions
./dev-tools.sh cleanup

# Clean up generated files for specific PHP version
./dev-tools.sh cleanup 83
